Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced world, stress, anxiety, and sleep issues have become extremely common, affecting both productivity and mental health. Music therapy is known to have positive effects on emotional well-being, yet most available platforms still offer generic playlists that don’t really consider the listener’s current mood or physical state. I want to develop a system that personalizes music therapy recommendations using AI something that can intelligently suggest the right kind of music based on a person’s emotions and state of mind.

Proposed Solution

My approach is to build a recommendation system that blends audio analysis and machine learning. The model will extract musical features from a dataset of therapeutic tracks using Librosa and group them into emotional categories such as calm, happy, sad, or energetic. Based on the user’s current mood or optional physical inputs like heart rate, the system will suggest appropriate tracks. I plan to create a simple Flask-based web interface where users can select their mood and receive personalized playlists. This project aims to make music therapy more adaptive and accessible in everyday life.
